When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Because it allows you to have a back up as well as access your code from other computers. It also allows you to share code with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you have more control and can make things public only when you're ready

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are only on github and are useful for copying someone else's code you want to use/work on.
Branches definitely exist locally and may exist remotely and are useful if you want to split off the main code and work on something new but related.
Clones are replicas of a repository. Can clone from github to local or local to local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It means you don't need an internet connection to work with the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Would have to communicate clearly in order to avoid errors. Hard to work on things simultaneously. Less learning curve for git.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

If you're working on something new and don't want to introduce to the main production code yet. It maintains separate yet connected project spaces.
