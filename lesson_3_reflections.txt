When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Because it allows you to have a back up as well as access your code from other computers. It also allows you to share code with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you have more control and can make things public only when you're ready
