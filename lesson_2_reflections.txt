What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It tells git to start potentially tracking things in that folder. You need to do it to begin using git - to set everything up.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area includes those files which will be tracked but have not yet been comitted. It delineates the files we want to track and have changed from those which are unchanged or untracked.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By only adding each logical change to the staging area each time you can break up work.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When there are logical reasons to diverge from the master version of a project. Branches take a copy then allow the differences to emerge.
